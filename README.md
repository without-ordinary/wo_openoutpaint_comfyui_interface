# OpenOutpaint ComfyUI Interface

An API interface for OpenOutpaint to work with ComfyUI workflows.

> NOTICE: This project is extremely cursed. You probably shouldn't do things like this does. :D

This now requires my fork of [openOutpaint](https://github.com/without-ordinary/wo_openOutpaint). This readme needs a lot of work still.

## Quickstart

1. Install this to ComfyUI (If you don't know how to do that, you really should not be touching this cursed abomination.)
1. Open or create a workflow for this (There may or may not be an example one in the repo.)
1. Toggle first node to run the server, configure the server address and port if needed, and run the workflow once.
1. Point [OpenOutpaint](https://github.com/zero01101/openOutpaint) at the address and port defined in the serving node.
1. ???
1. Profit.

# Features

A very shittily made API replacment for A1111's API in a ComfyUI workflow that runs within the ComfyUI webUI so you can use it as part of the interactive workflow.
